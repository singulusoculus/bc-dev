<p>I have been using WordPress since 2005 to build blogs and websites so when I joined up with the Pub Meeple board game group I offered to make a website for the group. I used the [Extra theme](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/extra/) from Elegant Themes to get it done. When we first started the site it was mainly a blog that we updated frequently. During my work on the Ranking Engine and the start of our podcast the blog took a back seat so the home page took on more of a landing page layout.</p>
<p>I am very happy with the design and layout of this site. It manages to get lots of content from over the years to the surface while not being cluttered.</p>
