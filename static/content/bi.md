<p>My primary job these last 12 years has been as a Business Intelligence Developer, Data Analyst, and SQL Administrator - first for an engineering and construction company and now for a private university. I provide analytics and technology solutions to university leaders so they can make the most informed decisions they can based on ERP and CRM data in Oracle and Snowflake using Cognos Analytics and Tableau. I also have extensive experience with Sharepoint, SQL Server, SSRS, and Solver BI360. I like to find answers to complex business situations in data and then turn them into solutions.</p>
<p>I am a well rounded business intelligence developer with years of experience working across multiple database systems and reporting tools. I am always interested to learn more.</p>
<p>My past roles also include:
- SQL Server administration - maintaining security, database backups, database servers, as well as writing database triggers, functions, and stored procedures.
- Share Point administration - supporting a large Sharepoint environment, administering security, setting up projects sites, and maintaining databases and backups
- Supporting and customizing Microsoft Dynamics SL ERP - This job required that I interact with users from all parts of the company - from the construction field to engineers to accountants. Fortunately my education was in accounting and I worked on the project side for several years so I can effectively communicate with them all.
