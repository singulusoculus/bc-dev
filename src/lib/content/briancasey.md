After learning Svelte I though I'd learn Sapper by creating something long over due: a personal development website for myself. But that wasn't the end of the journey. (Is there ever really an end?) SvelteKit was released and a great way to learn it was to convert this site. And you are looking at the results right now. SvelteKit is a great tool for this project as it gave me page routing and server side rendering.

I had a lot of fun designing and developing this site and I've got plans to add a blog and some other bits as time goes on.

If you like what you see here and want me to work on one of your projects, head over to the [Contact](/contact/) page and shoot me an email.
