As a life-long student and information junkie, it is in my nature to find new rabbit holes to dive into to see what I can pull out. Books, good conversations, podcasts, online learning and Google are all my close friends. But I don't like just to find new information. No, I like to grasp that information, ponder it, consider it, and find the ways that it intersects and impacts my life and the lives of others. I like to peer into the cracks of reality, see how things really work, and try to find better ways of doing life, work, and relationships. This applies to my whole self: as a husband and father, as a worker, as a friend.

Being an avid learner also means embracing your faults and mistakes as learning opportunities. We are surrounded by a cloud of learning opportunities each day. And this isn't just about optimization for the sake of optimization but for a better lived life, acknowledging that my life is finite and worth being spent on the things I love.
