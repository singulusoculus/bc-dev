Being brain-deep in a web development project is the thing that keeps me awake at night - in a good way. I started putting my toe on this path about 20 years ago learning HTML, CSS and some WordPress. I used what I learned to build web sites for myself and my friends, learning new little things as needed. It has been in the last 4 years that I have taken the deep dive into web development. I have since made a study of modern HTML, CSS, and, most importantly, JavaScript. In the beginning, I intentionally avoided JS frameworks to make sure I first understood what goes on under the hood.

The project that really got me going was the [Board Game Ranking Engine](https://rankingeninge.pubmeeple.com). Strategy board games are another of my hobbies and I wanted a way to easily rank a list of games. I found an example of a merge sort algorithm and off I went. If you want to see my progress as a web developer look no further than the iterations on this project. As it currently sits, it is written in vanilla JavaScript on top of WordPress using the [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/) design framework. My experience as a SQL developer and WordPress admin gave me the tools I needed to create the database piece for saving lists and results.

Since then I have delved into JS frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and most recently [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). The last in that list really grabbed me - I loved the new take on a framework not using the virtual DOM but more as a compiler. I have used Svelte to create the [Top Nine Generator](https://topnine.pubmeeple.com) app - a way to create top nine images for your board game collection. I then moved on to [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) to create the web site you are viewing now - but it has since been migrated to [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev). I think SvelteKit is amazing and have more plans to work with it in the future.

Web development is like falling down an endless rabbit hole - there is always something new to learn which is good for me since I am an avid learner.

You can find some examples of my web development work over on the [Projects page](/projects/).
